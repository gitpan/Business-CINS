Version 1.10
  03/11/02 - Fixed the validation. I foolishly relied a little too much on
    the Business::CUSIP module and completely screwed up the implementation
    of Business::CINS. It should be better now.

Version 1.00
  11/18/01 - Added the error() method.

Version 0.03
  5/9/01 - Added t/06-acc.t test.

  5/8/01 - Fixed documentation typo.
